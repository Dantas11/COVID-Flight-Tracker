# COVID-FlIGHT-TRACKER

## Project Description

This is our first Project we build a COVID flight Tracker an Interactive Front-End Application  
in this application we use two server-side APIs, client-side storage to store persistent data , Date picker and we used Tailwinds CSS framework.

## User Stories

As a traveler I want to be able to book a flight and know current COVID statistics of the location so that I can safely book my holiday.

As a traveler I am flexible on where I want to go but I am worried I don't meet the requirements for entry into their borders.
